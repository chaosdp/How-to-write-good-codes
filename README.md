How to write good codes:
solid
cry
lol
yeahp

ends
Returns

there is no good codes
dumbasses
there are just codes
and noncodes
period


alirght, continued
for me (the real unperturbed me)
writing codes is like being a human being
it tells you the 
characters, principles, patterns,

and most distinctively
the dna within the code
if the codes can be quantify and qualify
then yes
it can tells the people reading the codes
what kind of a person
code
she or he 
is

in the end,
codes is human 
after all

am i wrong
to said
that gods are not codes
not being humans
means 

there is something
beyond human codes

where as if ultra humans indeeds 
does 
can

however
that all depends on 
how humans are coded
in their codes
